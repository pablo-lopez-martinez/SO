# Operating System Project

This is a project developed during the lab of Operative System subject in the second year of Computer Science at University of A Coru√±a.

This program consists of a shell similar to a bash with some included functions and the ability to run any other command on the Unix System.

#Basic Usage

You can get a list of all the included functions by running the command "ayuda", and a small description of each one by running "ayuda command". You can also run any command installed in your system. To exit the shell you can run salir,fin,bye or exit.

#How to run the program 

You need to have gcc installed in a Unix Operating System. You can compile it with:

```
make
```
